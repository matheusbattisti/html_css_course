        <h2>About the band early years</h2>
        <p>
          The foundations for <span class="bold">The Offspring</span> began with
          guitarist/vocalist Bryan "Dexter" Holland (who was a drummer at the
          time) and bassist Greg Kriesel playing music together in a garage in
          Cypress, California in 1983.
        </p>
        <p>
          After hearing the <span class="bold">T.S.O.L.</span> album
          <span class="bold">Change Today?</span> at a party, and following a
          riot at a 1984 Social Distortion show, they decided to form a band
          called <span class="bold">Manic Subsidal</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Holland changed his role from drums to guitar, and the band was
          rounded out by singer Doug Thompson and drummer Jim Benton. Marcus
          Parrish briefly joined as a second guitarist, however, no recordings
          were made at this point.
        </p>
        <p>
          After Thompson was forced out, Holland took over vocals, and Benton
          was replaced by <span class="bold">Clowns of Death</span> drummer
          James Lilja. In 1985, school janitor Kevin "Noodles" Wasserman (also
          formerly of Clowns of Death) joined as a second guitarist, allegedly
          because he was old enough to purchase alcohol for the other members,
          who were under the legal drinking age.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1986, after changing their name to The Offspring (after a B-movie
          called The Offspring: They Were Born to Kill), the band released their
          first single: <span class="bold">"I'll Be Waiting"</span>.
